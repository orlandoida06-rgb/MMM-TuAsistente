# duckduckgo-images-api

Based on [KshitijMhatre's version](https://github.com/KshitijMhatre/duckduckgo-images-api) as it has been unmaintained.

A lightweight library to programmatically obtain image search results from DuckDuckGo's search engine.

## Usage

To install:

```bash
# npm
npm install @mudbill/duckduckgo-images-api

# bun
bun add @mudbill/duckduckgo-images-api
```

TypeScript definitions are included.

The package provides a simple async/await API:

```ts
const images = await imageSearch({
    // the search term
    query: "pikachu",

    // filter by safe search (default true)
    safe: true, 
    
    // number of result sets to fetch (default 1)
    // each set includes up to 100 images
    iterations: 1, 
    
    // number of retries if a query fails
    retries: 2, 
})
```

The `imageSearch` function returns a Promise that resolves to an array of complete results.

```ts
imageSearch({ query: "birds", safe: true })
    .then((results) => console.log(results));
```

The `imageSearchGenerator` function is an async generator that yields a Promise of each result set. Useful for large iterations.

```ts
for await (let resultSet of imageSearchGenerator({
    query: "birds",
    safe: true,
    iterations: 4,
})) {
    // 4 loops of 100 images each
    console.log(resultSet);
}
```

Please feel free to report any issues or feature requests.

### Note

DuckDuckGo provides an instant answer API. This package does not use this route. This package mocks the browser behaviour using the same request format. Use it wisely.
